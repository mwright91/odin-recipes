<h5>Better than the stuff from the jar! (Trust me)</h5>
    <p>
        I’m all about making sure the last little odds and ends of ingredients in my fridge or freezer get used up. So this week, instead of making just another batch of plain pasta and red sauce from a jar, I jazzed it up with a little leftover heavy cream, the last of a bag of spinach, and some Italian sausage instead of ground beef. Simple swaps and add-ins make this Creamy Tomato Pasta with Sausage a level up from your usual weeknight pasta!

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><input type="checkbox"> 1/2 lb. Italian sausage (hot, mild or sweet) </li>
        <li><input type="checkbox"> 2 cloves garlic</li>
        <li><input type="checkbox"> 2 Tbsp tomato paste</li>
        <li><input type="checkbox"> 1 28oz. can crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li><input type="checkbox"> 1 tsp Italian seasoning blend </li>
        <li><input type="checkbox"> 1/2 cup water</li>
        <li><input type="checkbox"> 1/2 lb. pasta</li>
        <li><input type="checkbox"> 1/3 cup heavy cream</li>
        <li><input type="checkbox"> 4 oz. fresh spinach</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <br>

    <ol>
        <li>Add the Italian sausage to a deep skillet or pot and cook over medium heat, breaking it up into pieces as it cooks. Mince two cloves of garlic, add it to the browned sausage, and sauté for 1 minute more.</li>
        <li>Next, add the tomato paste, crushed tomatoes, Italian seasoning, and water. Stir to combine and dissolve the browned bits off the bottom of the skillet. Allow the sauce to come to a simmer. Once simmering, place a tilted lid on top (to allow steam to escape while blocking splatter) and turn the heat down to medium-low. Let the sauce simmer, stirring occasionally, while you cook the pasta.</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of water to a boil for the pasta. Once boiling, add the pasta and continue to boil until the pasta is tender (7-10 minutes, depending on the variety). Drain the pasta in a colander.</li>
        <li>After the pasta has cooked and the sauce has simmered a while, stir the heavy cream into the pasta sauce. Add the fresh spinach and stir it into the sauce just until wilted.</li>
        <li>Finally, add the cooked and drained pasta to the sauce and stir to combine. Serve and enjoy!</li>
